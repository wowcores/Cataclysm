DiamondCore is a derivation/rewrite of MaNGOS, which was originally written
by Team Python and the WoW Daemon Team. Many people further helped DiamondCore
by submitting bug reports, code patches, and suggestions. Thanks to the
community!

Special thanks should go out to the WowwoW team. We have gained help from
them many times in the creation of this project. Keep up the good work guys.
